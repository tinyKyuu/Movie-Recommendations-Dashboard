## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was created as a way to gain more practical experience with Python and apply what I’ve learned in a real-world context. While I’ve previously dabbled in programming, I wanted to revisit it more seriously and develop my skills through hands-on practice. Rather than solely following tutorials, I believe the best way to learn is by building something from the ground up. This project gave me the opportunity to explore key technologies, sharpen my problem-solving skills, and demonstrate my enthusiasm for learning and growth in tech.
